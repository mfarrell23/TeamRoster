# TeamRoster
My motivation for making this project is to show how to extend files to create a new file.
This project takes small perameters from other .js files and uses them to create a new file with all the prompted questions.
## Use
To use this project user must open and install npm and inquirer.
User then needs to run index.js to access the prompts and loop through the questionares.
Once the user quits the html is then created.
## Collab
I had help from Nathan, a fellow classmate. He helped me make my code less repeated.
